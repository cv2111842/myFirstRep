/*
 Falling Distance
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to
determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
d = 12gt2
The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t
is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in
seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the
object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the
function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and
displays the return value.*/
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;


float fallingDistance(int t = 0);


int main() 
{

    int t = 0;
    float d = 0;
    
    cout << "This program will calculate the distance when the object falls " << endl;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
    {
        // receiving prototype 1
        d = fallingDistance (i); //prototype 1 repeats because it uses "i"
        cout << i << " second(s) " << d << " meters" << endl;
        //it is also reading d inside the prototype 1
        
    }
    
    
    
    
    return 0;
}

//prototype 1
float fallingDistance (int t) // turning t into a d 
{
    float d = 0;
    float g = 9.8;
    
    d = (0.5 * g) * (pow(t, 2));
    return d;
}
